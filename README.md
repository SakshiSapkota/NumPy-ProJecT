# ðŸŽ“ Student Marks Analyzer (NumPy Project)

A simple yet powerful Python project using **NumPy** to analyze marks of students across multiple subjects. This beginner-friendly tool demonstrates real-world use of arrays and statistical functions.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Stores student marks in a structured NumPy array
- Calculates:
  - Total marks per student
  - Average marks per student
  - Highest and lowest total scores
  - Top-performing student
- Outputs a clean, formatted report card

---

## ðŸ“Š Sample Subjects & Data

```python
Subjects = ["Math", "Science", "English", "Computer"]

marks = np.array([
    [88, 92, 79, 93],  # Student 1
    [76, 85, 83, 89],  # Student 2
    [91, 90, 77, 95],  # Student 3
    [70, 65, 80, 72],  # Student 4
    [94, 98, 90, 99]   # Student 5
])


# ðŸŽ² Dice Roll Analyzer using NumPy

This beginner-friendly Python project uses NumPy to simulate rolling a 6-sided dice 1000 times and analyzes the results. It teaches core NumPy concepts like random number generation, counting, and basic probability â€” all in one small CLI app!

---

## âœ… Features

- Simulates 1000 dice rolls (values 1 to 6)
- Counts how many times each face appears
- Calculates estimated probabilities
- Uses only NumPy (no other libraries!)

---

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- `np.random.randint()` for random number generation
- `np.bincount()` for counting values
- Looping and formatting output
- Probability basics with NumPy
